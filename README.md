# Dysarthria-detection-using-deep-learning-architecture
This project aims to detect dysarthria, a motor speech disorder, using deep learning techniques. It fuses acoustic features, speech timing patterns, and speaker embeddings for accurate classification. A CNN-LSTM model is trained on speech data to identify dysarthric and non-dysarthric speech.
